This project was developed as a solution to the 'Restaurants near me' problem, by using 2D trees to store and access 2-Dimensional data efficiently.

The input to this program would require 2 files: 'restaurant.txt' and 'queries.txt'\
'restaurants.txt' contains restaurants locations in the form of latitude and longitude.\
'queries.txt' contains the users locations (in the same format), i.e. the points from where the nearest restaurants are required.\
Note that two sample files 'queries.txt' and 'restaurants.txt' are already added. An example file for output is also added.\
To run the file, simply compile and execute the 'kdtree.java' file.
When the 'kdtree' file is executed, it creates an output file 'output.txt' which outputs the nearest restaurants around each of the query locations.

The kdtree is an very efficient and fast method of storing such data, with fast queries.
This implementation can be easily modified to process a large variety of data using 2d trees, and the query outputs can also be modified as per the requirement.
